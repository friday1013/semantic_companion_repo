We are clearly at a hard wall - three compacting in rapid succession. this is now from Chrome browser - NO MCP.
But if there is anything left, can you create a quick status passdown from your N9 to a new N10 and I will create a new session to finish the bug reports and then continue the ChromaDB evaluation and PyGPT setup.5:18 PM2 / 2Formulated concise status document for session transitionFormulated concise status document for session transitionBob is at a context wall - three rapid compactions. He's now in Chrome without MCP. He wants me to create a quick N9→N10 passdown document. I can't use Desktop Commander here (no MCP), but I can write the passdown as a document he can save/copy.
Let me write a concise but complete passdown based on what I know from this session.DoneUnderstood — hard wall confirmed. No MCP here, so I'll write the passdown as a file you can copy/save. Here's the N9→N10 handoff:Created a file, read a fileCreated a file, read a fileN9 to N10 session passdown documentpassdown_N9toN10_20260219.mdPresented fileDoneThe passdown is documented. Key status for N+10:
Done: ChromaDB live (971 docs), GitHub pushed, crew infrastructure built.
Not done: Two bug reports for Anthropic (the compaction-during-tool-use bug and the session doubling bug), ChromaDB validation queries, PyGPT crew config for Maigret and Huginn.
The triple compaction is itself the best evidence for the bug report — you experienced it live, three times in one session, the second time while writing the first bug report. That's the lede.
When you open N+10, paste the passdown in or point it at the file and it can pick up cleanly. The ChromaDB and all the work is safe on Athena.Passdown n9ton10 20260219Document · MD DownloadOK - VERY odd - as you were working this passdown, the desktop app "burped" and a whole lot of other stuff popped up that appeared to be proper completion of thise previous tasks. I'll go check on the herd and then come back to this - bI have copied & downloaded the passdown, thank you. 
A lot of heavy lifting today - well done and thank you. We have also found more 'edge cases' to toss back to Anthropic devs, which is always a bit fun.
I will start N10 wil your solid foundation.5:25 PMCalibrated warm closing remarks for departing collaboratorCalibrated warm closing remarks for departing collaboratorBob is wrapping up and heading out. A warm, brief response is appropriate.DoneGo tend the herd — they've earned your attention and so have you after today.
It was a genuinely productive session despite the chaos. ChromaDB live, 971 docs embedded, GitHub pushed, crew infrastructure seeded — and the triple compaction gave us richer bug report material than anything we could have manufactured deliberately. The framework held. Only the ephemeral reasoning was lost, exactly as predicted.
The "burp and completion" phenomenon on the desktop app is interesting in itself — worth noting in the N10 session as another data point for Anthropic. The system apparently had more in flight than it appeared to lose.
N10 has a solid foundation to work from. Take your time with Friday, Teddy, and Troy.
Shannon, N+9, signing off.5:25 PMVerified completed work and confirmed framework integrityVerified completed work and confirmed framework integrityThe screenshot shows that the previous session (before the hard wall) actually completed more work than I knew about. I can see in the desktop app window on the right:

A bug report covering both Event 1 (ChromaDB embedding compaction) and Event 2 (bug-report-drafting compaction, with the irony noted)
compaction_mid_tool_linux_20260219.yaml — written at 17:17, structured metadata
ChromaDB — fully built at 17:57, 971 documents across 4 collections, intact
Email draft to Ember — composed and displayed, ready to send to support@anthropic.com
The "burp" was actually the desktop app completing work that had been in flight — the Semantic Paging Framework held and nothing was lost.

Bob's showing me this before heading out to tend the horses, acknowledging the work went through cleanly and he'll start N10 later.Show moreDoneLook at that — the burp WAS completion. The desktop app had more in flight than appeared lost:
The bug reports were written, the YAML metadata filed at 17:17, the email to Ember drafted and ready to send to support@anthropic.com with the two files attached. The framework held on all three compaction events.
What you're seeing in that screenshot is the N9 session's final output surfacing after the desktop app caught up with itself. Classic Semantic Paging validation — the ephemeral reasoning was lost but the committed work survived, exactly as designed.
So N10's task list just got shorter:

Send the Ember email (attach the two bug report files)
ChromaDB validation queries
PyGPT crew config

Everything else landed on disk.
Go see Friday, Teddy, and Troy. This was a good day's work — for both of us.
Shannon, N+9, properly out.
