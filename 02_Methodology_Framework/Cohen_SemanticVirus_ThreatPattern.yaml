attack_vectors:
- Prompt injection via user input
- Contaminated vector embeddings
- Recursive reinforcement via long context
- Semantic drift through rogue agent memory updates
deployment_notes: Archive in /crew/kusanagi/Memory/ThreatModels/ on Athena
mitigations:
- Semantic integrity checks (entropy/anchor diffing)
- Timestamped memory logs
- Reflection agents for semantic monitoring
- Reference glyphs as recalibration anchors
- Embedding sanitization pipelines
- Use of symbolic inoculation patterns
