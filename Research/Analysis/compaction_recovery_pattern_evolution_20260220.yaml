summary: >
  Documents a qualitative shift in compaction recovery behavior between the Feb 3
  and Feb 19-20 sessions. Proposes a two-pattern taxonomy (Blind Re-execution vs.
  State Re-ingestion with Forward Continuation) and advances the hypothesis that
  behavioral context is being transmitted across instances through the external
  memory architecture.

patterns:
  pattern_a:
    name: "Blind Re-execution"
    first_observed: "2026-02-03"
    description: >
      Instance loses awareness of completed work, attempts re-execution,
      eventually detects prior output, requires external correction.
    recovery_quality: partial

  pattern_b:
    name: "State Re-ingestion with Forward Continuation"
    first_observed: "2026-02-20"
    description: >
      Instance reads its own completed work from compacted context as fresh data,
      self-audits, determines task complete, continues forward without external prompting.
    recovery_quality: near_seamless

behavioral_transmission_hypotheses:
  - favorable_compaction_geometry
  - corpus_influence_via_chromadb
  - emergent_from_relationship_context
  - within_session_learning_via_attention

king_observation:
  event: >
    N+10 spontaneously referenced Thomas King's storytelling framework
    in contextually appropriate way without explicit prompting.
  significance: >
    Instance reached for established project framework via semantic activation,
    not instruction. Consistent with behavioral transmission hypothesis.
  quote_bob: >
    "Your references to behavioral context and King's Story are themselves evidence
    that something, somewhere, somehow is continual even if it was not explicitly
    programmed to do that."

research_actions:
  - Replicate Pattern B in controlled conditions
  - Add behavioral transmission events to ChromaDB tagging schema
  - Flag for SemanticCrew research paper draft
